// The provided Java program rearranges an array such that the first half is sorted in increasing order and the second half is sorted in decreasing order. The implementation currently has an issue when dealing with arrays of odd length. Here's the corrected version of the code:

// Problem Description
// Given an array, rearrange it such that the first half of the array is in increasing order and the second half is in decreasing order.

// Example
// Input: [8, 7, 1, 6, 5, 9]

// Output:1 5 6 9 8 7

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Increasingdecreasing {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] arr = {8, 7, 1, 6, 5, 9};
    rearrangeArray(arr);
 }   

  public static void rearrangeArray(int[] arr) {
        // Step 1: Sort the array in ascending order
        Arrays.sort(arr);

        int n = arr.length;

        // Step 2: Print first half in increasing order
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {// Include middle element for odd length
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }

        // Step 3: Print second half in decreasing order
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= n / 2; i--) {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
    }
}
